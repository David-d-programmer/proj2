## Credits

- Most the things done here was from the lessons i learned in the video i watched and also my mentor who held me by the hand and told me to write the idea first in a book before implementing. some of my idea was also motivated in the short rock, paper and scissors video i watched.
  
- i also got some of my idea from stackoverflow and checking the internet.
